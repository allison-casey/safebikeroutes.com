  ## Safe Bike Routes: LA

  <p className='text-slate-500'>
    Because Google Maps Bike Routes are ass and we don't want to die.
  </p>

  Safe Bike Routes is a community project to document the ways to get around
  Los Angeles by bike with as little risk as possible. The only reason this
  project exists, is because of the abject failure of Los Angeles and other
  unincorporated cities in the area to treat people on bicycles as human
  beings worthy of a life of dignity. The status quo is not okay, and we
  should all raise our voices for a better Los Angeles. Until then though,
  we hope this map helps you make the most of life on two wheels in this
  city. It can be a beautiful, liberating, and empowering experience that
  opens your eyes to this city and it's people.


  These routes are a crowdsourced effort drawn from personal experience and
  satelite imagery. If you notice anything wrong with them, would like to
  suggest new routes to add, or just want to get in contact with us, send us an
  email at <span className='underline hover:decoration-blue-400'><a href="mailto:support@safebikeroutes.com">support@safebikeroutes.com</a></span>

  ### Legend
  - <span className='bg-black font-bold underline text-[yellow]'>dashed yellow</span>:
    routes are intended to be ridden on the sidewalk and only used to
    connect major routes that would otherwise fall under the other route types
  - <span className='font-bold underline text-[#c2a5cf] '>dashed blue</span>:
    routes are on street routes that follow all the rules laid out below
  - <span className='font-bold underline text-[#c2a5cf]'>solid blue</span>:
    routes are on street painted bike lanes
  - <span className='font-bold underline text-[#7b3294]'>dark purple</span>:
    routes are on street protected bike lanes
  - <span className='font-bold underline text-[#008837]'>dark green</span>:
    routes are off street cycle tracks

  ### The Rules
  - sharrows only allowed on narrow residential streets
  - bicycle gutters only allowed on 2 lane roads
  - if it's any wider than two lanes (including center turn lane) it must be
    somehow physically separated
  - routes should strive to be as contiguous as possible, cross multiple 
    arterials exclusively at signalized intersections, and provide safe routes across freeway boundaries
  - everything else is ass and LADOT should get their shit together
